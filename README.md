# SAT Image

This project focuses on the classification of soil types in satellite pictures based on multi-spectral values. By analyzing the different spectral bands captured by satellite imagery, we aim to develop a robust classification model that can accurately identify and categorize soil types. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the application of machine learning algorithms for classification. The results of this project can have applications in various fields such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and land management.
